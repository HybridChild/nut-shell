# Example credential configuration for nut-shell-credgen
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file: cp credentials.toml.example credentials.toml
#   2. Customize usernames, passwords, and access levels
#   3. Add credentials.toml to .gitignore (IMPORTANT!)
#
# SECURITY:
#   - Never commit credentials.toml to version control
#   - Passwords will be hashed with random salts during code generation
#   - Generated code contains only hashed credentials (safe for binary)

# Fully-qualified type path to your AccessLevel enum
# This should match your application's AccessLevel type
access_level_type = "my_app::AccessLevel"

# Define users with plaintext passwords
# Each user must have: username, password, level

[[users]]
username = "admin"
password = "change-me-in-production"  # Use strong passwords in production!
level = "Admin"  # Must match a variant from your AccessLevel enum

[[users]]
username = "user"
password = "user-password"
level = "User"

[[users]]
username = "guest"
password = "guest"
level = "Guest"

# Notes:
# - Usernames must be unique
# - Level names must exactly match your AccessLevel enum variants
# - Each password gets a unique random salt during generation
# - Generated credentials are const-initializable for no_std environments
